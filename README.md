# Tissot Softkeys Enabler

Magisk module for enabling soft navigation keys and disabling the capacitive buttons on tissot (Xiaomi Mi A1)

## What it does

* Enables softkeys (on-screen back, home, and multitasking buttons)
* Disables hardware buttons

## What it doesn't do

* Disable capacitive buttons' backlights ([why?](#why-didnt-you-also-disable-the-capacitive-buttons-backlights))

## Disclaimer

Specifically built for and tested exclusively on the unofficial LineageOS 15.1 build for tissot.

No guarantee that it works on other Oreo (or Nougat) builds.

## Why didn't you also disable the capacitive buttons' backlights?

There's a built-in setting to disable the backlights in LineageOS 15.1 at `Settings > System > Buttons > Backlight`.
